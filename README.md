# Square-One
Square-One is an interactive game for teaching programming in which players assemble block-based code and write code in programming languages to solve puzzles. Every part of the game is highly customizable, and uses can play the game using whichever method suits their programming skills.

## Getting Started

Import Game.js:

```html
<script src = "Game.js"></script>
```

And initialize the Game by providing a reference to a canvas tag

```js
let game = new Game(document.querySelector("canvas"));
game.start();
```
